## Overview

This repository contains a collection of weekly coding challenges that I am using to level up my software engineering skills through deliberate practice. These challenges are designed to help me learn new programming languages and technologies by building small but complete applications or tools inspired by real-world utilities.

## About the Challenges

Each challenge requires writing a full application or tool. The projects are selected to be manageable within my spare time, allowing me to build something functional and learn through hands-on experience.

## Repo Structure

- **00-wc_tool:** The wc (word count) tool is a command-line utility in Unix-based operating systems that counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file or input text. It's a simple yet powerful tool often used for text processing.
